   "Question": "Which locking methods are available for goods movement with SAP ECC?",
   "Answer": "Currently two different locking methods are available for goods movements:\n- The first method locks all affected materials exclusively on their plant level during the entire document processing stage. This method is called “Exclusive block” in Customizing.\n- The second method involves individual locking of material master and valuation data. Reduced exclusive locking times are used to minimize the collision probability between parallel postings. This method is called “Late block” in Customizing.\nFurther information [Note 2338387] (https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0002338387)",

This indicator in SAP ERP was so far optional and not set by default.\nIn S/4HANA, the update of the inbound delivery is enforced to ensure the data consistency across different applications.

Analysing this information helps buyers determine the types of products and areas in need of further contract and negotiated prices. The off-contract app enables the buyer to analyse and control such purchases, resulting in improved procurement processes and reduced costs.\nDetails can be found [here] (https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F0572')/S13OP).",

   "Answer": "Column store in SAP HANA is highly optimized for column operations such as search and aggregation.There is no default sorting of a result set for a SELECT statement unlike other database systems which are often sorted by index (primary or seconday) that has been used to access data. So the program logic must not rely on implicit sorting. Wherever result set should be sorted ORDER BY clause should be used.",

Instead it sometimes makes sense to manage a number of assets on one master record with collective management.The only requirement is that you enter a basic unit of quantity in the asset master record for the collective asset. When postings occur for these assets, the system updates for this quantity, according to the debit/credit indicator of the transaction.",

   "Question": "Can we assign the IAS accounting principles to an extension ledger?",
   "Answer": "An extension ledger is assigned to a standard ledger and inherits all journal entries of the standard ledger for reporting. Postings made explicitly to an extension ledger are visible in that but not in the underlying standard ledger. This concept can be used to avoid duplication of journal entries if many business transactions are valid for both ledgers and only a few adjustments are required in the extension ledger. The extension ledger only can be used for manual postings. For more details refer the blog [Extension Ledger use cases](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/04/02/sap-s-4hana-extension-ledger-use-cases/)",

   "Question": "How do SDMs (especially downtime SDMs) work in connection with ZDO of SUM?",
   "Answer": "SDM was developed to make ZDO possible in the first place. The aim is to move the data migrations, which would actually cause a downtime, to the uptime. Then, the data is converted in the uptime. Enqueues are used to ensure consistent reading and writing. The application must support the fact that there can be two data models on one release at the same time. The application can then terminate this compatibility in the next release and only support the new data model. This only works if the customer updates every release. Therefore downtime SDMs don't work with ZDO, because a jump upgrade is made which is not ZDO capable.",

These SDMs run at the end of the upgrade if the system is already on Release N+X.\nAt this point, only one instance is available (ASCS+PAS) and there are only a correspondingly small number of DIA work processes available. As a result, the SDMs will probably take a long time to run. Ideally, the SDMs would run when all instances (ASCS+PAS+AAS) are available again, so that significantly more DIA WP resources can be utilized.",

The first option would be to install a \"Ready-To-Use\" Appliance with SAP Best Pratices [Link](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2041140). Those appliances can be installed via the Cloud-Appliance Library (CAL). The second option is to activate the SAP Best Pratices content on a new client (preferably Best Pratices Client) in an installed S/4 HANA OP system - either on premise or hosted in the cloud.",

   "Question": "Can I activate SAP Best Pratices without a SAP Best Practices Client?",
   "Answer": "In general it is not recommended to activate SAP Best Practices on a classic client because there may be conflicts with existing customizing. Nevertheless this so called \"merged client\" might be reasonable especially when you are missing some customizing which is only available when doing a regular copy of client 000. If you choose the merged client alternative, additional activation errors occur because the client 000 settings already exist and the Best Practices activation tries to populate the same configuration.

If you want to use a standalone Fiori front-end server it is recommended to put its database instance in a separate tenant together with the S/4 HANA database instance as long as you are using HANA as a database for the front-end server. MCOD or MCOS deployment models are possible but as HANA 2.0 comes with MDC \"out of the box\" it is advisable to use those features in order to save hardware ressources but maintain a clear separation of users and roles as well.",

   "Answer": "As a first starting point for debugging Fiori apps, check the developer tools of your browser. In Internet Explorer you can press F12. Please check the network tab and look for elements which cannot be loaded. For ODATA Service based Fiori apps, check transaction /IWFND/ERROR_LOG for further investigation. For other app types like Webdynpro ABAP, you should also have a look at the RFC destination of type H beeing used. A common error for example is that the URL for the back-end server (which is stored in the RFC connection) is not reachable for the client through the Webdispatcher, because the hostnames are not published externally.",

You can edit the view with transaction SM30 and create a mapping between the source system alias and the target system alias. The target system RFC will then derived by adding the suffix _RFC or _HTTPS. For example: The source system alias is \"S4FIN\", target system alias is \"S4HCLNT100_TRUSTED\". Then, there must be at least a RFC connection called \"S4HCLNT100_TRUSTED_RFC\".",

Therefore a new trust-relationship will be initiated from back-end, jumps via RFC into the front-end and creates the new RFC-connection „trusting@<SID>_<Inst. Number>“ there!

   "Question": "What is the difference between a conversion and a classical ERP upgrade regarding the SUM procedure?",
   "Answer": "The S/4HANA system conversion is based on the switch upgrade procedure within Software Update Manager (SUM). During a S/4 HANA system conversion or S/4 HANA upgrade, SUM calls the Simplification Item Check Report /SDF/RC_START_CHECK in two phases during the runtime. That´s why for somebody executing the technical conversion, a system conversion is like an upgrade but with the additiional task of the Simplification Item Check. Keep in mind that the return code (RC) of the check report needs to be less than 4 (only warnings left) in order to proceed with the technical conversion, e. g. to the execution phase of SUM.",
